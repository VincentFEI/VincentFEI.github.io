        1 Background Biomimetic robotic fish, by imitating the shape and oscillatory propulsion mechanism of real fish, exhibit numerous advantages such as high mobility, minimal environmental disturbance, and strong concealment, making them a new type of underwater robot with significant research value and broad application prospects. However, under current energy technology conditions, the energy that robotic fish can carry is limited, making it difficult to perform long-distance, long-duration, and large-scale marine tasks. Therefore, enhancing the endurance of robotic fish has become a critical issue that needs to be addressed.
In nature, the hitch-hiking behavior of remora fish provides inspiration for solving this problem. Remora fish attach themselves to larger fish or marine animals using their dorsal suckers, and rely on the host’s movement to travel long distances and feed. Although the remora fish itself has poor swimming ability, it can migrate and navigate between different marine areas due to its unique adhesion ability. Inspired by this, combining the adhesion mechanism with the fish-like swimming method, we have developed an adhesive bionic robotic remora. By utilizing the hitch-hiking behavior, the robotic fish can reduce energy consumption, potentially greatly improving its endurance. Additionally, the adhesive function has potential applications in multi-robot systems and covert reconnaissance tasks for specific targets.
Based on the above background, this project aims to develop a novel adhesive bionic robotic remora and achieve fully autonomous adhesion tasks. In pursuit of this goal, the project focuses on the following aspects: system design and modeling of the adhesive bionic robotic remora, underwater visual localization based on artificial markers and refraction correction, and autonomous adhesion control for static and moving targets. The specific framework is shown in the figure below.
2 Innovative Achievements 2.1 System Design and Modeling of Adhesive Bionic Robotic Remora The world’s first prototype of an adhesive biomimetic robotic remora was developed, including the design of the electromechanical system, low-level motion control software, and upper-level graphical user interface. Specifically, the robotic fish includes four main systems: the motion system, perception system, adhesion system, and communication system. Innovations were made in each of these systems:
Motion System: Designed omnidirectional pectoral fin joints and a compact buoyancy adjustment device, endowing the robotic fish with exceptional 3D mobility. Perception System: Developed a binocular perception system with an active gimbal structure, enabling large-scale underwater environmental perception. Adhesion System: Optimized the hardness and shape of the biomimetic sucker and designed a system with both perception and active adhesion capabilities. Communication System: Designed and implemented the RFLink communication protocol for underwater multi-robot communication, ensuring accurate and efficient data transmission. The 3D dynamic model of the robotic fish was completed, along with a visualized 3D motion simulation environment. Specifically, the following work was completed:
Dynamic Modeling: Using the Newton-Euler method, the dynamic models of the robotic fish body and buoyancy adjustment device were created. A quasi-steady lift-drag model and the Lighthill’s large amplitude elongated body theory, were used to analyze the forces on static and oscillating fins, ultimately resulting in a complete 3D motion model. 3D Motion Simulation: A visualized 3D motion simulation environment was developed based on the derived kinematic model. Actual motion data from the robotic fish was used for parameter identification. The developed simulation environment exhibits high fidelity and can even reproduce advanced maneuvers such as spiral descents, forward flips, and horizontal rolls. 2.2 Underwater Visual Localization Based on Artificial Markers and Refraction Correction Designed and implemented an underwater stereo visual-inertial localization algorithm based on ArUco markers. This algorithm provides accurate positioning information for the robotic fish’s autonomous adhesion tasks, with the following features:
The system analyzed the refraction model and imaging characteristics of the flat waterproof cover. The position and orientation estimation method for ArUco markers was re-derived and designed for taking into account the refraction distortion effects. Using an error-state Kalman filter framework, IMU raw data and ArUco marker pose estimation results were fused to obtain more stable and precise position estimates for the robotic fish. Designed and implemented an underwater fish-eye visual localization method based on LED markers. This algorithm also provides precise positioning information for the robotic fish’s autonomous adhesion tasks, with the following features:
An image recognition and pattern matching algorithm was developed for LED markers, enabling rapid and stable detection of markers and the determination of matching relationships for feature points. The system analyzed the refraction model and imaging characteristics of spherical waterproof covers and used DLT and LM algorithms to optimize the pose estimation of LED markers. 2.3 Autonomous Adhesion Control for Floating Targets Designed an autonomous adhesion control strategy based on a finite-state machine, describing the process of autonomous adhesion to floating targets as six states: cruising search, target approach, pose adjustment, adhesion control, adhesion maintenance, and detachment control. Motion controllers for each sub-state were designed and implemented in a physical robotic fish prototype. Related results were published in IEEE Transactions on Mechatronics.
Proposed a planar position control algorithm based on tail fin driving, establishing a planar averaged dynamic model for tail-driven robotic fish. A orientation-velocity control objective with velocity constraints was designed, and a nonlinear model predictive control approach was used to solve for the final control inputs. The proposed algorithm was validated in a simulation environment, demonstrating its ability to effectively overcome the challenges posed by the robotic fish’s underactuated characteristics and achieve stable and precise position control. The related results were published in Nonlinear Dynamics.
Proposed a planar pose control algorithm based on pectoral fin mode switching. The control process was divided into two phases: path tracking and fine adjustment. During the path tracking phase, virtual paths and mode-holding regions were introduced to enable fast convergence of lateral position and heading errors. In the fine adjustment phase, a hyperbolic tangent function was used to adjust the amplitude of pectoral fin oscillation, ensuring convergence of the longitudinal position error. Proposed a depth control algorithm based on a nonlinear disturbance observer. A vertical motion model based on the buoyancy adjustment device was established, and feedback linearization and disturbance observation techniques were used to design a depth controller.
2.4 Autonomous Adhesion Control for Moving Targets Designed an autonomous adhesion control strategy based on a finite-state machine, describing the process of autonomous adhesion to moving targets as five states: cruising search, target tracking, synchronized adhesion, adhesion maintenance, and detachment control. Motion controllers for each sub-state were designed and implemented in a physical robotic fish prototype. Related results were published in IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics. Proposed a multi-modal motion-based planar state synchronization control algorithm. Given the underactuated characteristics of the robotic fish, the control was decomposed into lateral and longitudinal control. Lateral control employed line-of-sight navigation to track the heading of the moving target with the tail fin, while longitudinal control simplified the system to a second-order integrator model with external disturbances. A sliding mode controller was designed for controlling the pectoral fins, ensuring that the position and velocity of the robotic fish converged to the moving target. 3 Videos 3.1 Nonlinear Model Predictive Position Control 3.2 Underwater Stereo Visual-Inertial Localization 3.3 Autonomous hitch-hiking behaviors for stationary hosts 3.4 Autonomous hitch-hiking behaviors for moving hosts 4 Publications Pengfei Zhang, Zhengxing Wu, Yan Meng, Min Tan, Junzhi Yu.

        1 Background The propulsion mechanism of the bionic robotic fish, which generates thrust through the reciprocal swinging motion of the fish body, inevitably causes instability in the robot’s attitude. Among these, the periodic oscillation of the yaw angle and roll angle is particularly severe. The oscillation in attitude leads to fluctuations in the sensor data of the robotic fish, which can significantly degrade the quality of image data (motion blur), creating major challenges for the robot environmental perception. Based on this background, this project focuses on two areas of research: fish body attitude stabilization technology and sensor attitude stabilization technology.</p>
